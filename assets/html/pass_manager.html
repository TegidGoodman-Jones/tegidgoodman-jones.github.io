					<h2>Password manager</h2>
					
					<p>This is an app I primarily made for personal use. We all have so many passwords that its very easy to lose them or misplace the post-it-note where your wrote it down. I, myself, struggle with this problem, so I decided to make a suitable place to store all my passwords. This is also a great opportunity to learn SQL and how to use it with python.</p>
					

					<p>I wrote this app with functional programming in mind, therefore it is very structured and is designed to have a very tidy main loop. </p>

					<p>It starts off creating a database and creating tables within this database. The app then gives the user the option of adding passwords, deleting passwords, reading passwords and updating them.</p>

					<p>I used the SQLite3 module to interact with the database, this allows me to have complete control of the database and sql from the python file.</p>

					<p>The encryption of the passwords was done from a custom module which relied on the cryptography python module. I got to learn about encryption keys through doing this and I gained a lot of knowledge in the area.</p>

					<p>I am currently using this as a full time password manager and I donâ€™t think, from using it that there are many improvements that it needs.</p>
